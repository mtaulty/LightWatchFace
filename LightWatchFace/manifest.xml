        MT: I selected SDK 1.4 here because I got some hint from a forum post here
        https://forums.garmin.com/developer/connect-iq/f/discussion/164539/updated-device-list/896008#896008 
        which suggested that the Forerunner 45 was on 1.4 plus when I selected later SDKs (specifically 3.x)
        I found that the tooling didn't offer me the Forerunner 45 as a possible target.
